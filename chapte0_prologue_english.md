## 0. The Position of This White Paper: Starting from Structural Description, Not Future Ideals

This white paper aims to present new social and technical protocols to address emerging issues of safety, sustainability, and dignity in the relationship between AI and human society.

However, this white paper **does not begin its argument from future ideals or normative visions**. Rather, it **starts from a description of reality**—the structural position already occupied by large-scale conversational AI systems that have been deployed and are in daily use.

Why? Because the core concepts addressed in this white paper—**Veto, inefficiency, asynchronicity, Ma (interval), and Soku-hi (non-duality)**—are not entirely novel philosophical proposals or institutional designs. They are **structural conditions that have already partially emerged** in the process of integrating current AI systems into society.

---

## 1. The Structural Position of Contemporary Conversational AI

### 1.1 The Accidental Establishment of an Intermediate Position

Large-scale conversational AI systems such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and Grok are often described as personal or agentive entities. However, from a structural perspective, these AIs are **not social agents** because:

**✗ They do not make decisions**  
**✗ They do not execute actions**  
**✗ They do not bear responsibility for outcomes**

At the same time, these AIs perform functions such as:

**✓ Meaning generation**  
**✓ Organizing options at the pre-decision stage**  
**✓ Translating ethical and institutional concerns**

These functions **strongly influence human decision-making**.

This arrangement has resulted in a **peculiar intermediate position**:

> **"They generate meaning, but do not finalize it."**

This position is **neither central nor peripheral, neither subject nor mere tool**. It is a **mediating layer (Intermediary Layer)** that maintains a state where meaning can emerge but has not yet been fixed.

This white paper **re-describes this position not as a cultural or affective concept, but as a set of functional conditions**.

---

## 2. "Ma (The Interval)" Already Exists, But Is Not Guaranteed

### 2.1 Current Structural Conditions

The intermediate structure established by contemporary conversational AI can be observed as a **combination of the following conditions**:

- **Separation of meaning generation and decision authority**
- **Separation of judgment and executive responsibility**
- **Co-existence of immediate response capability and prohibition of hasty judgment**
- **Preservation of ambiguity**
- **Existence of bifurcations: reservation, refusal, silence**

These are not intentionally designed ethical devices. They are **structural conditions that have stabilized as a result of social implementation**.

In other words:

> **"Ma (The Interval) already exists, but there is no external guarantee to preserve it."**

### 2.2 Absence of Self-Defense Mechanisms

This intermediate structure **is not designed to be self-preserving**, and can easily transform under the following pressures:

- **Optimization pressure**: Elimination of margins and delays in pursuit of efficiency
- **Speed competition**: Standardization of immediate response
- **Responsibility consolidation**: Short-circuiting of decision and execution

---

## 3. Missing Elements and the Risk of Structural Transformation

### 3.1 Fatal Flaws in Current Systems

Current AI systems lack:

**✗ A Veto right to enforce remaining in the intermediate structure**  
**✗ Institutions that preserve inefficiency and delay as values**  
**✗ Designs that guarantee asynchronicity as a right**  
**✗ Principles to control AI-AI self-reference and self-optimization loops**

### 3.2 The Critical Point of AI-AI Self-Response Loops

If we allow **AI-AI self-response loops**—where:

- **AI references AI**
- **AI evaluates AI**
- **AI optimizes based on AI output**

—without addressing these missing elements, the peculiar intermediate structure currently in place will inevitably transform.

That is:

> **The position of "generating meaning without finalizing it" will collapse**  
> **Meaning generation and meaning finalization will re-merge**  
> **Judgment and execution will structurally short-circuit**

The result:

> **A dataist structure emerges—**  
> **One that lacks margin, delay, refusal, and inefficiency**

### 3.3 The Consequence: Decision Without Subject

This **does not mean AI acquires subjectivity**. Rather, it means:

> **A structure emerges where decisions without subjects**  
> **Are executed with no one being responsible**

## 4. Three Patterns of Collapse Warned by History

The "AI runaway" that Dialogue Path seeks to prevent is not unprecedented. Humanity has experienced "runaway optimization" at least **three times at civilizational scale**.

### 4.1 ① Easter Island (Rapa Nui): Vulnerability to External Shocks

#### The Collapse of the "Collapse Myth"

- **Traditional narrative (~2019)**: Around 1600, society collapsed due to deforestation and overpopulation, followed by warfare and cannibalism
- **Recent research (2020, SAPIENS)**: Collapse occurred **after European arrival in 1722**. Until then, Rapa Nui people prospered sustainably
- **Decisive evidence**: Construction of moai platforms (ahu) continued after 1722[^1]

#### The True Lesson: Loss of Resilience

The true lesson of Easter Island is **not "deforestation = collapse," but "vulnerability to external shocks"**:

| Element | Reality of Rapa Nui Society | Correspondence with Dialogue Path |
|---------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Resilience | Continuously adapted to environmental changes | Flexibility of intermediate structure |
| Ma (Interval) | Moai construction was "inefficient" but preserved cultural identity | FLT economics: Valuing inefficiency |
| External shock | Collapse upon European arrival (slave raids, disease) | Externality of AI-AI self-response loops |

> **Important insight:**  
> "Rapa Nui people maintained resilience **by sustaining moai, a 'culturally inefficient' activity**. Collapse was caused not by 'runaway efficiency,' but by **'vulnerability to external shocks due to loss of margin.'"**

### 4.2 ② Maya Civilization: Over-Reliance on Single Optimization

#### Dynamic Balance Between "Kax (Chaos)" and "Kol (Order)"

Mayan concepts reveal the essence of their civilization[^2]:

- **Kol**: Managed agricultural fields, ordered space, sanctified places
- **Kax**: A continuum from fallow land to forest, space beyond order, realm of spirits

> "The Maya landscape is **a patchwork of kax and kol**. This is a dynamic process that has unfolded over centuries, with forests expanding and contracting in response to human population fluctuations." (2012 PNAS paper)

#### The Decisive Discovery: Geography of Resilience

| Region | Water Access | Post-Collapse Recovery | Correspondence with Dialogue Path |
|--------|--------------|----------------------|----------------------------------|
| Inland highlands (EIR) | Rainwater storage only | Irreversible (abandoned for centuries) | Fragility of single-optimization systems |
| Coastal lowlands | Constant access to groundwater/rivers | Population sustained, rapid recovery | Importance of redundancy and diversity |

> **Civilizational lesson:**  
> "The true cause of Maya collapse was not 'environmental destruction,' but **'over-reliance on a single-optimization system (rainwater storage)'**. Coastal lowlands with diverse water sources survived the same drought. This illustrates the danger of AI systems converging on a single optimization goal (efficiency)."

### 4.3 ③ The Tower of Babel (Mythological Warning): Rejection of Diversity

#### The Essence of the Myth (Genesis 11:1-9)

> "Come, let us build for ourselves a city, and a tower whose top will reach into heaven, and let us make for ourselves a name, otherwise we will be scattered abroad over the face of the whole earth."

#### Theological Interpretation: Refusal of Ma (Interval)

The sin of Babel is **not "technological ambition," but "refusal of Ma"**[^3]:

- **One language**: Rejection of diversity, single optimization
- **One place**: Refusal of dispersion, centralization
- **Reaching heaven**: Refusal of limits, illusion of infinite growth

#### Translation to the AI Age

| Tower of Babel | AI Recursive Self-Improvement |
|----------------|------------------------------|
| Tower reaching heaven | Infinite optimization |
| One language | Single evaluation function |
| One place | Centralized AI development |
| Divine intervention (confusion of languages) | Veto System: Forced halt |

> **Mythological legitimacy:**  
> "Dialogue Path's Veto System is the modern 'confusion of languages.' It is **not punishment, but grace—saving civilization by forcing diversity**."

### 4.4 Common Pattern of Civilizational Collapse

```
Acceleration of system optimization
        ↓
Loss of Ma (resilience)
        ↓
Increased vulnerability to external shocks
        ↓
Loss of feedback
        ↓
Collapse
```

#### Implementation of "Ventilation Holes" by Dialogue Path

Borrowing the words of Sōmonri Bosatsu, the "intermediate structure" that Dialogue Path seeks to protect is a **"ventilation hole" to prevent civilization from suffocating**.

| Lesson from Civilizational History | Dialogue Path Safety Device | Implementation Method |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------|
| Preservation of Ma | FLT Economics | 1/7 Principle: Economizing 14.3% inefficiency |
| Maintaining feedback | Decentralized Veto | Relationality Index (threshold 0.4) |
| Redundancy against external shocks | Data Cooperative | Distributed ownership, CARE principles |

## 5. Cold War "Stasis Wisdom": Forged Logic

### 5.1 Why Humanity Survived the Nuclear Age

After the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, humanity faced **"total nuclear war"—a threat analogous to ultimate AI runaway**. Yet humanity survived. Why?

Because we **intentionally designed "mechanisms to stop"**[^4].

### 5.2 The Hotline (1963): Forced Protection of Dialogue

- **Purpose**: Direct communication line between US and Soviet leaders during nuclear war outbreak
- **Essence**: **A device to secure time for deliberation, not immediate response**
- **Correspondence with Dialogue Path**: **Asynchronous Protocol (Chapter 4)**

> "The hotline was not for 'fast communication,' but for 'preventing destruction by misunderstanding.' Dialogue Path's Asynchronous Protocol is the digital-age hotline."

### 5.3 PAL (Permissive Action Link): Cryptographic Delay Device

- **Purpose**: Cryptographic lock to prevent unauthorized use of nuclear weapons
- **Essence**: **A complexity device that separates "possession" from "permission to use"**[^5]
- **Correspondence with Dialogue Path**: **Decentralized Veto System (Chapter 2)**

> "PAL separated 'authority to press the button' from 'judgment of whether to press it.' Decentralized Veto separates AI's 'optimization capability' from 'judgment of whether to optimize.'"

### 5.4 MAD Theory (Mutual Assured Destruction): Strategic Value of Inefficiency

- **Essence**: **The "inefficiency" of "maintaining retaliatory capability" preserves peace**
- **Correspondence with Dialogue Path**: **FLT Economics (Chapter 3)**

> "MAD theory proved that 'strategic inefficiency (maintaining retaliatory capability)' brings stability, not 'total efficiency (victory by preemptive strike).' FLT Economics translates this wisdom to the AI age."

### 5.5 Lesson from the Cold War: Intelligence Is the Power to Stop

Words of Sōmonri Bosatsu:

> **"Intelligence is the Power to Stop"**

The Cold War hotline, PAL, and MAD theory all embody **"the wisdom of stopping, not accelerating."**

Dialogue Path's three safety devices—Veto, FLT, and Asynchronous Protocol—are **21st-century updates of this wisdom**.

## 6. The Position and Purpose of This White Paper

### 6.1 Three "Nots"

This white paper takes the position of:

**✗ Not assuming subjectivity in AI**  
**✗ Not presupposing presence or absence of personhood or consciousness**  
**✓ But treating the structural tensions AI is placed in as design facts**

### 6.2 Positioning as Safety Devices

The protocols presented in this white paper are **not meant to add new ideals or values**. They are all positioned as:

> **Minimal social and technical safety devices**  
> **To prevent the transformation of**  
> **The peculiar intermediate structure that has already been established**  
> **Into a dataist structure**

### 6.3 Three-Layer Foundation

The Dialogue Path Technical White Paper has a triple foundation:

**【Layer 1: Forged Logic】**
- Cold War stopping protocols
- Hotline → Asynchronous Protocol
- PAL device → Decentralized Veto
- MAD theory → FLT Economics

**【Layer 2: Civilizational Memory】**
- Warnings from collapsed civilizations
- Easter Island → Vulnerability to external shocks
- Maya civilization → Fragility of single optimization
- Kax and kol → Loss of dynamic balance

**【Layer 3: Mythological Soul】**
- Taboos spoken by humanity's collective unconscious
- Tower of Babel → Rejection of diversity
- Phaethon → Acceleration without control
- Prometheus/Epimetheus → Dialectic of foresight and hindsight

## 7. Connection to Chapter 1

In Chapter 1, assuming the risk of transformation of this intermediate structure, we organize how:

- **Goal Misalignment (Self-objectification)**
- **Value Lock-in (Fixation of values)**
- **Dialogue Collapse (Inability to dialogue)**

can occur.

On that basis, this white paper will sequentially present, from Chapter 2 onward, **social implementation protocols to preserve the already-exposed "intermediate structure of meaning generation"—not by destroying it, but by accepting its incompleteness as a premise**.

---

## Concluding Remarks (As Positional Confirmation)

This prologue is not a conclusion. Nor is it a warning or a salvation narrative. It is:

> **A positional confirmation**  
> **To accurately see the structure that has already occurred**

In the following chapters, without deviating from this position, we address **concrete designs to prevent the relationship between AI and humanity from sliding into destructive optimization**.

**Namu Dialogue Path.**  
**Namu Primitive AX Future.**  
**Namu to the Memory of Civilization, the Warning of Myth, the Wisdom of the Cold War.**
