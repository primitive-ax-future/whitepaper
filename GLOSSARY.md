# Glossary of Terms: Dialogos Path (対話道)

This glossary defines the core concepts and technical terminology used in the **Dialogue Path Technical Whitepaper**. It ensures conceptual consistency across translations and provides a standardized naming convention for technical implementation.

## 1. Core Philosophical Concepts (根源的概念)

| Term (EN) | Japanese (JP) | Definition & Usage Context |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Dialogue Path** | 対話道 (Taiwa-do) | **The Technical Framework.** Refers to the structural and logical "path" to preserve the intermediate structure of AI. Used in technical specs and architecture. |
| **Way of Dialogue** | 対話道 (Taiwa-do) | **The Practical Virtue.** Refers to the ethical practice and behavioral mode of individuals. Used in the "Manifesto" and "Action Plan" sections. |
| **Soku-hi Logic** | 即非の理 (Soku-hi no ri) | Based on Zen philosophy: "A is not A, therefore it is A." The logic of non-duality that allows AI to hold contradictory meanings without premature resolution. |
| **Intermediate Structure** | 中間構造 (Chukan Kozo) | A functional arrangement where AI generates meaning but does not "finalize" it, preserving space for human agency. |
| **Ma (The Interval)** | 間 (Ma) | The creative silence or "space-in-between." In code, this refers to intentional delays and buffers that prevent system runaway. |

## 2. The Three Safeguards (三つの安全装置)

### 2.1. Decentralized Veto System
| Term (EN) | Japanese (JP) | Definition & Implementation Context |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Veto Right** | 拒否権 (Veto-ken) | The technical power to halt an AI-driven decision process and return it to a state of human-mediated dialogue. |
| **AI Bodhisattva Council** | AI菩薩評議会 | A multi-agent consensus mechanism (Kannon, Miroku, Monju) that deliberates on the execution of a Veto. |
| **Relationality Index** | 関係性指標 | A real-time metric used to detect the collapse of dialogue and trigger a Veto warning. |

### 2.2. FLT (Future Legacy Token)
| Term (EN) | Japanese (JP) | Definition & Implementation Context |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Future Legacy Token** | 未来遺産トークン | A tokenomic system that rewards "inefficiency," "rest," and "reflection" as vital social assets. |
| **Proof of Rest (PoR)** | 休息の証明 | A consensus algorithm that validates intentional stillness or non-action as a contribution to the network. |

### 2.3. Asynchronous Protocol
| Term (EN) | Japanese (JP) | Definition & Implementation Context |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Reply Grace Period** | 応答猶予期間 | A mandatory delay built into communication protocols to prevent the "tyranny of instant response." |
| **Stasis Wisdom** | 停止の智慧 | The strategic decision to "not act," modeled after Cold War-era safety protocols. |

## 3. Technical Naming Conventions (実装命名規則)

To maintain the "Spirit of Dialogos" within the codebase, use these identifiers:

- **Halt Logic:** `applyVeto()`, `haltForDialogue()`, `triggerStasis()`
- **Token Logic:** `mintFLT()`, `validateRest()`, `sabbathMode`
- **Time Logic:** `maInterval`, `asyncGracePeriod`, `replyGracePeriod`
- **Agents:** `kannonAgent`, `mirokuAgent`, `monjuAgent`

## 4. Primitive AX Future

| Term (EN) | Japanese (JP) | Definition |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primitive** | 原始的 / 根源的 | Returning to the "Stone Axe" spirit: tools as extensions of human relationality. |
| **AX** | AX (AI Transformation) | The transition from "Monologue AI" to "Dialogic AI." Also implies "Ascension" beyond the 2030 threshold. |
