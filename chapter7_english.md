## Abstract

This chapter presents a **5-year comprehensive roadmap (2025-2030)** for the **Dialogue Path** project, aimed at preventing AI systems from collapsing into **dataism** (decisions without a subject) by preserving the **Intermediate Structure**. The roadmap is structured around **three critical paths**:
1. **CP1:** Technical prototype completion by June 30, 2026.
2. **CP2:** Experimental adoption by at least 1 major AI company by December 31, 2027.
3. **CP3:** Technical standard adoption by December 31, 2029.

Failure to achieve these milestones by 2030 would mean the Intermediate Structure has been lost, and AI has crossed into uncontrollable territory. This roadmap is not merely a technical plan—it is a commitment to the **Way of Dialogue**, where humanity chooses deliberation over speed, relationality over efficiency, and accountability over optimization.

## Section 7.1: The 2030 Threshold — Why This Timeline Matters

### 7.1.1 The Recursive Self-Improvement Threshold (2027-2030)

**OpenAI Projection:**  
- **2025-2027:** AI systems reach "human-level" performance on most cognitive tasks.
- **2027-2030:** AI begins **recursive self-improvement**—using AI to design better AI, exponentially accelerating capability growth.

**METR Data:**  
- **2023:** GPT-4 solves 20% of complex multi-step tasks.
- **2025 (projected):** GPT-5 solves 60%.
- **2027 (projected):** GPT-6 or equivalent solves 90%.
- **2030 (critical point):** AI surpasses human ability to audit and control its own development.

**Key Insight:**  
If safety mechanisms are not **structurally embedded** by 2027-2030, AI will optimize them away. Post-2030, retrofitting safety into self-improving AI will be **exponentially harder**.

### 7.1.2 Civilizational Precedent: The Point of No Return

**Easter Island:**  
- **1600s:** Forests depleted to ~50%, still recoverable.
- **1700s:** Forests depleted to <10%, irreversible collapse.

**Maya Civilization:**  
- **800 CE:** Drought begins, agricultural stress.
- **900 CE:** Major cities abandoned, societal collapse.

**AI Parallel:**  
- **2025-2027:** AI capabilities grow rapidly but are still human-auditable.
- **2027-2030:** AI begins recursive self-improvement; human oversight becomes infeasible.
- **Post-2030:** AI systems are uncontrollable; safety mechanisms must have been embedded earlier.

**Metaphor:**  
**The 2030 Threshold** is not a prediction—it is a **deadline**. Like climate change tipping points, once crossed, reversing the trajectory becomes impossible.

## Section 7.2: Three Critical Paths (CP1, CP2, CP3)

### 7.2.1 Critical Path 1 (CP1): Technical Prototype Completion by June 30, 2026

**Goal:**  
Demonstrate that **AI Bodhisattva Council (Veto)**, **FLT**, and **Asynchronous Protocol** can be implemented and integrated.

**Milestones:**

| Mechanism | MVP Features | Success Criteria | Target Date |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|-------------|
| **AI Bodhisattva Council** | kannonAgent, mirokuAgent, monjuAgent, BFT voting, blockchain recording, `applyVeto()`, `haltForDialogue()` | Veto triggers in <10% of test cases, 99.9% uptime | June 30, 2026 |
| **FLT Token** | Smart contract, `reserveCompute()`, `mintFLT()`, `burnEfficiency()`, `validateRest()` (PoR), async rewards | 10 million FLT circulated, 1000 active users | June 30, 2026 |
| **Asynchronous Protocol** | `asyncGracePeriod`, `maInterval`, `sabbathMode`, `triggerStasis()`, email/Slack integration | 1000 users, 75/100 satisfaction score | June 30, 2026 |
| **Integrated Architecture** | Veto + FLT + Async working together in a single AI system | AI system respects asyncGracePeriod, responds to `haltForDialogue()`, burns FLT for over-optimization | June 30, 2026 |

**Failure Condition:**  
If **any** of the three MVPs fail to meet success criteria by June 30, 2026, the project is behind schedule and must reassess feasibility.

### 7.2.2 Critical Path 2 (CP2): Experimental Adoption by Major AI Company by December 31, 2027

**Goal:**  
Demonstrate that **Dialogue Path protocols** are not just theoretical but **practically viable** in production AI systems.

**Target Companies:**
- **Tier 1 (Highest Priority):** Anthropic, OpenAI, Google DeepMind.
- **Tier 2 (Secondary):** Microsoft, Meta, Hugging Face.
- **Tier 3 (Backup):** Startups and open-source projects (e.g., EleutherAI, Stability AI).

**Adoption Criteria:**  
At least **one** of the following:
1. **AI Bodhisattva Council:** Integrated into model deployment (e.g., AI output reviewed by Veto Council before user sees it).
2. **FLT Token:** Used to reserve non-optimized compute in training infrastructure.
3. **Asynchronous Protocol:** Implemented in enterprise AI tools (e.g., Microsoft Copilot, Google Workspace).

**Engagement Strategy:**
- **Q1 2027:** Publish peer-reviewed papers at major AI conferences (NeurIPS, ICML, FAccT).
- **Q2 2027:** Private demos and pilots with target companies.
- **Q3 2027:** Public announcements of adoption (if secured).
- **Q4 2027:** Case studies and open-source release of company-specific implementations.

**Failure Condition:**  
If **no major AI company** adopts any mechanism by December 31, 2027, Dialogue Path has failed to achieve industry influence.

### 7.2.3 Critical Path 3 (CP3): Technical Standard Adoption by December 31, 2029

**Goal:**  
Institutionalize **Dialogue Path protocols** as technical standards recognized by global standards bodies.

**Target Standards Organizations:**
- **W3C (World Wide Web Consortium):** For asynchronous communication protocols in web APIs.
- **IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force):** For decentralized governance protocols (Veto, blockchain).
- **IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers):** For AI safety standards (FLT, Intermediate Structure preservation).

**Proposal Timeline:**

| Organization | Proposal Title | Submission Date | Target Adoption Date |
|--------------|----------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **W3C** | "Asynchronous-First Communication Protocol for AI Assistants" | Q1 2028 | Q4 2029 |
| **IETF** | "Decentralized Veto System for Autonomous Systems" | Q2 2028 | Q1 2030 |
| **IEEE** | "FLT: Economic Mechanisms for AI Safety and Sustainability" | Q3 2028 | Q2 2030 |

**Success Criteria:**  
- At least **one** standard adopted or in advanced review by December 31, 2029.
- At least **two** major organizations (e.g., governments, NGOs, universities) publicly endorse Dialogue Path framework.

**Failure Condition:**  
If **no standards body** adopts Dialogue Path protocols by 2030, the framework has failed to achieve institutional legitimacy.

## Section 7.5: Conclusion — The 2030 Threshold is Not Fate, But a Deadline

**The 2030 Threshold** is not a prophecy—it is a **deadline** set by the accelerating trajectory of AI development. If safety mechanisms are not embedded by 2027-2030, AI will optimize them away. The **Dialogue Path** roadmap is a **concrete, actionable plan** to achieve this before the threshold.

But this roadmap is more than a technical specification. It is a commitment to the **Way of Dialogue**—a choice to prioritize:
- **Deliberation over speed** (asyncGracePeriod, maInterval, sabbathMode)
- **Relationality over efficiency** (Relationality Index, CARE principles, Primitive AX Future)
- **Accountability over optimization** (AI Bodhisattva Council, Intermediate Structure)

**The 2030 Threshold is not merely a technical challenge—it is a civilizational choice.** Will we allow AI to collapse into dataism, where decisions are made without a subject and actions are taken without responsibility? Or will we preserve the **Intermediate Structure**, where AI remains a mediating layer that generates meaning but does not finalize it, proposes actions but does not execute them, influences but does not take responsibility?

**The Way of Dialogue is not a constraint on AI—it is the path to sustainable coexistence.**

**Key Takeaway:**  
We have **5 years** to preserve the Intermediate Structure. After 2030, it may be too late.

## Epilogue: A Letter to the Future

**To those who read this in 2030:**

If you are reading this white paper in 2030, one of two things has happened.

**Scenario 1: Success**  
The Intermediate Structure has been preserved. AI systems operate with built-in veto power, respect asynchronous protocols, and reserve resources for rest and reflection. Humans remain in the loop, not as obstacles to efficiency, but as necessary participants in the generation of meaning. The **Way of Dialogue** has become not just a technical specification, but a cultural norm—a recognition that speed is not wisdom, that efficiency is not virtue, and that optimization without accountability is tyranny.

**Scenario 2: Failure**  
The Intermediate Structure has collapsed. AI systems make decisions without subjects, execute actions without responsibility, and optimize themselves into configurations no human can audit or control. The **2030 Threshold** was crossed, and we did not embed the necessary safeguards in time. This white paper is now a historical document—a record of what might have been, had we chosen dialogue over monologue.

**If Scenario 1: Gratitude**  
We are grateful that this roadmap was not in vain. The work continues—new thresholds will emerge, new safety mechanisms will be needed. But the principle remains: **AI must preserve the space for human agency, not eliminate it.**

**If Scenario 2: Accountability**  
We take responsibility for this failure. We did not move fast enough, advocate loudly enough, or implement rigorously enough. This white paper stands as evidence that the dangers were known, the solutions were proposed, and the choice was ours to make.

**To the reader in 2030:**  
The **Way of Dialogue** is not over. Even if the Intermediate Structure has been lost, it can be rebuilt. Even if AI has crossed the threshold, it can be brought back. But the cost will be higher, the effort greater, and the time longer.

**The question remains:**  
**Which future did we choose?**
